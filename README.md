# PQStreamDeck

This is a Stream Deck profile file that can be imported into the Stream Deck desktop software (https://help.elgato.com/hc/en-us/sections/360004110952-Elgato-Stream-Deck-Software) and used on any Stream Deck hardware, Stream Deck mobile (free or pro), or attached to the macro keys of a Corsair keyboard.

A few notes:

ðŸ”¸ The first button in the profile currently is configure to trigger the Power Query Launch tool in Ken Pul's Monkey Tools Excel add-on. If you are not a Monkey Tools user, you can configure this button to open Excel or Power BI from whatever app you're currently in.

ðŸ”¸ The second button (open Advanced Editor) expects to find "Open Advanced Editor" as the first button on your Quick Launch Toolbar.  If this is not the case, you can either adjust your Quick Launch Toolbar, or revise the keyboard shortcut associated with this button in the profile.

ðŸ”¸ The third button (new blank query) expects to find "New Blank Query" as the second buttton on your Quick Launch Toolbar.  Again, if this is not the case, you can either adjust your Quick Launch Toolbar, or revise the keyboard shortcut associated with this button in the profile.

I hope you find this helpful and enjoyable to use.  If you have any suggestions for future revisions or additions, please let me know.
